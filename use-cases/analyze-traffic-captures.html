  <h2>Why it matters</h2>
  <p class="lead">
    Full packet captures are an invaluable source of information for incident
    investigation, but rarely available after the fact:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Traditional packet capture requires a lot of storage space</li>
    <li>
      There is no direct linkage to alert(s) requiring further investigation
    </li>
    <li>Traffic is captured from limited number of locations, if at all</li>
  </ul>

      <h2>How we can help</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          SensorFleet Traffic Recorder provides integrated traffic capturing
          triggered by alerts from other Instruments, for example IDS's
        </li>
        <li>
          User can easily navigate to relevant traffic snapshot from the alert
          of interest
        </li>
        <li>
          Captured snapshots are stored on Sensors triggering the alerts. This
          optimizes required bandwidth and provides a broad coverage
        </li>
      </ul>

  <h2>Bigger picture</h2>
  <p>
    Distributed and integrated traffic capturing speeds up incident
    investigation significantly. With the SensorFleet solution, users can take
    this capability in use simply by installing Traffic Recorder Instrument. No
    additional infrastructure work required. Analysis of captures can be done
    directly in SensorFleet solution using the integrated Arkime instance in
    case an analyst does not want to move captures to an external analytics
    solution.
