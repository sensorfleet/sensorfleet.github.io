  <h2>Why it matters</h2>
  <p class="lead">
    Isolated networks are not always as well isolated as you would think. Common
    problems in network isolation monitoring are:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Even though the failures in network isolation are usually rather simple
      from a technical standpoint, there are no automated tools to detect them
    </li>
    <li>
      While audits can help in fixing issues, they are point checks in time
    </li>
    <li>
      Increasing amount of infrastructure is being outsourced. In many cases,
      customers' only option is to trust the vendor's assurances
    </li>
  </ul>

      <h2>How we can help</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          SensorFu Beacon automates the testing of network segregation. Cover
          multiple and diverse points of failure at once
        </li>
        <li>Get immediate feedback if leaks occur</li>
        <li>
          Network isolation monitoring doesn't require special permissions,
          network access or hardware deployment. “Trust but verify” your
          vendors' cyber security posture.
        </li>
      </ul>

  <h2>Bigger picture</h2>
  <p>
    Testing network segregation is a fundamental security control. Automated
    audit solution covers multiple and diverse points of failure. Instead of the
    user having to wait until the next audit engagement, they can get an alarm
    if leaks appear in the segregated network. The best part is that Beacon
    Instrument is easy to deploy and spawn throughout the organization.

      The feasibility study conducted by the National Cyber Security Centre
      Finland (NCSC-FI) revealed that 81% of the participating organisations'
      isolated networks leaked in unexpected ways.
