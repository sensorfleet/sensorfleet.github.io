  <h2>Why it matters</h2>
  <p class="lead">
    Convergence of IT, OT and Cloud based networks can create unexpected
    connections between the critical and untrusted networks. Continuous
    connections monitoring helps in keeping the organization’s exposure at
    minimum. We can look at connections monitoring on three levels:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Outbound and inbound connections to Internet
    </li>
    <li>Connections between the network segments. For example IT-OT boundary</li>
    <li>Device level connections within the network segments </li>
  </ul>
