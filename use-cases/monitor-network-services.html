  <h2>Why it matters</h2>
  <p class="lead">
    Having visibility on network services (ports) and configuration changes
    is a critical piece in defensive cyber security strategy. It helps to
    understand an organization's exposure and enables hardening of networks
    by closing the unnecessary ports. Some key considerations are how to:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Gain a holistic view on both Internet exposed services and open ports
      within the network segments
    </li>
    <li>Automate the scanning process</li>
    <li>Get notifications about changes against the baseline</li>
  </ul>

      <h2>How we can help</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          SensorFleet PortDiff provides an easy way to scan for both
          Internet exposed services and within the internal network segments
        </li>
        <li>
          Scanning is fully automated with configurable scan intervals and
          port ranges to scan
        </li>
        <li>
          After the initial inventory scan, notifications on the changes
          against the baseline are provided
        </li>
      </ul>

  <h2>Bigger picture</h2>
  <p>
    Small scale, occasional port scans are easy to do manually but lack the
    scalability. Automation provides coverage, regularity and pinpoints the
    changes against the baseline. Distributed sensor network is a flexible
    staging platform for implementing a comprehensive port monitoring
    process.

      The IBM Security X-Force Incident Response (IR) team analyzed cases
      over the last year involving cloud breaches and identified the most
      commonly exploited vulnerabilities and misconfigurations: — Virtual
      machines and other resources with default security settings that were
      erroneously exposed to the Internet. This included misconfigured
      platforms and insufficiently enforced network controls that exposed
      internal services directly to the Internet.
