  <h2>Why it matters</h2>
  <p class="lead">
    Having visibility on network services (ports) and configuration changes is a
    critical piece in defensive cyber security strategy. It helps to understand
    an organization's exposure and enables hardening of networks by closing the
    unnecessary ports. Some key considerations are how to:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Gain a holistic view on both Internet exposed services and open ports
      within the network segments
    </li>
    <li>Automate the scanning process</li>
    <li>Get notifications about changes against the baseline</li>
  </ul>

      <h2>How we can help</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          SensorFleet PortDiff provides an easy way to scan for both Internet
          exposed services and within the internal network segments
        </li>
        <li>
          Scanning is fully automated with configurable scan intervals and port
          ranges to scan
        </li>
        <li>
          After the initial inventory scan, notifications on the changes against
          the baseline are provided
        </li>
      </ul>

  <h2>Bigger picture</h2>
  <p>
    Small scale, occasional port scans are easy to do manually but lack the
    scalability. Automation provides coverage, regularity and pinpoints the
    changes against the baseline. Distributed sensor network is a flexible
    staging platform for implementing a comprehensive port monitoring process.

      The IBM Security X-Force Incident Response (IR) team analyzed cases over
      the last year involving cloud breaches and identified the most commonly
      exploited vulnerabilities and misconfigurations: â€” Virtual machines and
      other resources with default security settings that were erroneously
      exposed to the Internet. This included misconfigured platforms and
      insufficiently enforced network controls that exposed internal services
      directly to the Internet.
