      <h2>Why it matters</h2>
      <p class="lead">
        Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) adoption has become more commonplace
        especially through their integration with firewalls. While the
        integrated and centralized IDS’s are definitely recommended, they may
        leave several gaps:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Proper visibility across different networks such as OT, is lacking
        </li>
        <li>
          Attacks finding their way or originating from beyond the firewall
          remain undetected
        </li>
        <li>
          Detection can’t be fine-tuned for each protected network. For example
          IT vs. OT
        </li>
      </ul>

          <ul>
            <li>
              SensorFleet platform makes it easy to deploy lightweight Sensors
              across networks, running IDS’s as Instruments
            </li>
            <li>
              Distributed deployment provides a second line of defence and more
              granular detection
            </li>
            <li>
              IDS instances can be managed as a group, but also fine tuned
              individually
            </li>
          </ul>

      <h2>Bigger picture</h2>
      <p>
        Distributed IDS deployment is a part of defence in depth strategy and
        helps organizations to monitor otherwise “dark” corners of their
        networks. SensorFleet platform can be used for deploying and managing
        both Suricata and Zeek instances, either individually or as groups.
