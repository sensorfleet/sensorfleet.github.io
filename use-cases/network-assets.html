        A critical step in cyber defense is to understand what to defend.
        Visibility on networked assets is a fundamental building block of
        comprehensive cybersecurity monitoring. Currently, OT networks are a
        major driver for asset monitoring demand. The key questions to consider:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The initial inventory of the install base. This is especially relevant
          with OT networks that often have outgrown initial documentation
        </li>
        <li>
          Holistic view on assets. IT and OT are increasingly intertwined
          calling for unified visibility
        </li>
        <li>
          Automated change monitoring. Continuous monitoring is needed for
          configuration mistakes and rogue devices
        </li>
      </ul>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Traffic Guard Instrument creates asset inventories with passive
              monitoring of network traffic
            </li>
            <li>
              SensorFleet’s cross-platform software enables easy deployment
              across different environments
            </li>
            <li>
              After the inventory, Traffic Guard provides continuous monitoring
              for any changes
            </li>

      <h2>Bigger picture</h2>
      <p>
        It is possible to retrieve asset information from switches and similar
        network devices, but achieving comprehensive visibility is time
        consuming. Even then, real-time discovery of changes may be missed.
        Traffic Guard is easy to deploy on SensorFleet fabric and can be
        combined with other exposure mapping capabilities.

          We see three major challenges for SOCs resulting from the increased
          complexity of the IT and OT environment in a company: First, the
          infrastructure is becoming more complicated and intertwined, making it
          difficult to maintain situational awareness and a cohesive overview.
          Managers and analysts have poor visibility into the network because
          they cannot keep track of all the devices in the network…
