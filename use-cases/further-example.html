      <h2>Why it matters</h2>
      <p class="lead">
        Majority of cybersecurity solutions focus on detection and protection.
        While this is a necessary first step in stopping the attacks, it is also
        just that, a first step. Often, the hard work, finding out what has
        happened or what is going on, starts after the initial alert.
      </p>
      <p>The common challenges responders face:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Finding out the context and details of the alert is a manual process
          of combing through disparate data sources
        </li>
        <li>Necessary data may be unavailable altogether</li>
        <li>
          Associating relevant forensic data to original alert is detective work
        </li>
      </ul>

              SensorFleet supports forensic data collection, along with the
              detection, with comprehensive set of Instruments like Traffic
              Recorder, Netflow and PassiveDNS
            </li>
            <li>
              Forensic data will be collected automatically and close to source
              that triggers an alert
            </li>
            <li>
              Data collection triggered by SensorFleet detection Instruments
              will be automatically associated with the alert

      <h2>Bigger picture</h2>
      <p>
        Combining forensic data collection and detection with the
        automatically generated context information accelerates incident
        investigation. Forensic data, while centrally manageable, is stored
        locally on the Sensors. This protects integrity of the network
        segregation, saves bandwidth and enables granular data retention
        policies.
