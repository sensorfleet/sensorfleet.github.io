      <h2>Why it matters</h2>
      <p>
        Majority of cybersecurity solutions focus on detection and protection.
        While this is a necessary first step in stopping the attacks, it is also
        just that, a first step. Often, the hard work, finding out what has
        happened or what is going on, starts after the initial alert. The common
        challenges responders face:
      </p>
      <ol class="steps">
        <li>
          Finding out the context and details of the alert is a manual process
          of combing through disparate data sources
        </li>
        <li>Necessary data may be unavailable altogether</li>
        <li>
          Associating relevant forensic data to original alert is detective work
        </li>
      </ol>

            Combining forensic data collection and detection with the
            automatically generated context information accelerates incident
            investigation. Forensic data, while centrally manageable, is stored
            locally on the Sensors. This protects integrity of the network
            segregation, saves bandwidth and enables granular data retention
            policies.
