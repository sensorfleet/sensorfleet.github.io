  <h2>Why it matters</h2>
  <p class="lead">
    In every organization, there is confidential information that needs to be
    kept safe. Canary tokens are an effective and nearly zero-false-positive way
    to detect breaches. Just like honeypots, they are underutilized due to:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Largely manual and labor intensive deployment process</li>
    <li>Lack of automation to keep the solution up to date</li>
    <li>
      Lack of easy results retrieval from a large network of canary tokens
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Bigger picture</h2>
  <p>
    Canary tokens are an effective solution to do lightweight intrusion
    detection - you will get a notification whenever someone downloads your
    canary file. If you ever get such an event, the chances are that your
    network is compromised or someone with legitimate access accidentally found
    the file and didn't know of it being a canary trap.
  </p>
  <p>
    The best part is, you're not required to modify your infrastructure. Just
    plant the canary files, and the SensorFleet solution will alert you and
    collect the results if a breach occurs.
