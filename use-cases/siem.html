      <h2>Why it matters</h2>
      <p class="lead">
        SIEM solutions have been around for over a decade and are becoming a
        standard tool for security operations. Despite this, there are several
        challenges that may prevent users from getting a full value out of the
        SIEM. The most prominent among them:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>How to get a comprehensive coverage of the data sources</li>
        <li>
          Volume of the events leads to alert exhaustion and operating cost
          increase
        </li>
        <li>
          Alert is just the first step. Investigating the alerts remains largely
          manual work
        </li>

          <h2>How we can help</h2>
          <p>SensorFleet solution can help on multiple fronts:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              A core Instrument on the Sensor platform for adding value to SIEM
              is Log Forwarder. This local log target can ingest logs from
              multiple sources and pass them to SIEM using SensorFleet native
              services, making it easy to gain coverage. Furthermore, Log
              Forwarder can perform pre-filtering and buffering of the logs,
              helping with the data volume.
            </li>
            <li>
              Once the Sensor has been deployed, new detection Instruments can
              be added dynamically. How does adding new data sources help with
              the volume? Several SensorFleet Instruments provide discrete and
              actionable alerts, such as new network assets or services
              discovered, optimizing quality over quantity.
            </li>
            <li>
              After a high priority alert, the hard work of investigation
              begins. SensorFleet platform supports a range of forensic data
              collection Instruments, such as Traffic Recorder, Netflow and
              PassiveDNS. When used together with LogForwarder or detection
              Instruments, wealth of data related to alerts will be right at the
              fingertips of the responder.

      <h2>Bigger picture</h2>
      <p>
        Decoupling the data collection layer from analytics will be beneficial
        for longer term development of an organizationâ€™s cybersecurity
        capabilities, providing the freedom to change SIEM or SOC operator
        solutions and services. Data collection layer itself, when implemented
        with SensorFleet cyber capability fabric, can be independently augmented
        with the new capabilities.
