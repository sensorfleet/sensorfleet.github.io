  <h2>Why it matters</h2>
  <p class="lead">
    SIEM solutions have been around for over a decade and are becoming a
    standard tool for security operations. Despite this, there are several
    challenges that may prevent users from getting a full value out of the
    SIEM. The most prominent among them:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>How to get a comprehensive coverage of the data sources</li>
    <li>
      Volume of the events leads to alert exhaustion and operating cost
      increase
    </li>
    <li>
      Alert is just the first step. Investigating the alerts remains largely
      manual work
    </li>
  </ul>

      <h2>How we can help</h2>
      <p>SensorFleet solution can help on multiple fronts:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          A core Instrument on the Sensor platform for adding value to SIEM
          is Log Forwarder. This local log target can ingest logs from
          multiple sources and pass them to SIEM using SensorFleet native
          services, making it easy to gain coverage. Furthermore, Log
          Forwarder can perform pre-filtering and buffering of the logs,
          helping with the data volume.
        </li>
        <li>
          Once the Sensor has been deployed, new detection Instruments can
          be added dynamically. How does adding new data sources help with
          the volume? Several SensorFleet Instruments provide discrete and
          actionable alerts, such as new network assets or services
          discovered, optimizing quality over quantity.
        </li>
        <li>
          After a high priority alert, the hard work of investigation
          begins. SensorFleet platform supports a range of forensic data
          collection Instruments, such as Traffic Recorder, Netflow and
          PassiveDNS. When used together with LogForwarder or detection
          Instruments, wealth of data related to alerts will be right at the
          fingertips of the responder.

  <h2>Bigger picture</h2>
  <p>
    Decoupling the data collection layer from analytics will be beneficial
    for longer term development of an organization’s cybersecurity
    capabilities, providing the freedom to change SIEM or SOC operator
    solutions and services. Data collection layer itself, when implemented
    with SensorFleet cyber capability fabric, can be independently augmented
    with the new capabilities.
