      <p class="lead">
        Honeypots are an effective and low noise solution for detecting lateral
        movement and attackers who may have gained entry to the network.
        Currently, they are underutilized in the internal networks due to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Largely manual processes needed to deploy and maintain the network of
           honeypots 
        </li>
        <li>
          Concerns over the proper isolation of honeypots from the rest of
          the network
        </li>
        <li>
          Lack of easy results retrieval from a large network of honeypots
        </li>

              SensorFleet provides an easy and automated platform for the
              honeypot deployment and management
            </li>
            <li>
              Sensor platform implements containerisation and isolation for 
              the honeypot
            </li>
            <li>
              Results from the honeypot network are retrieved automatically 
              and can be directed to SIEM or other analytic solutions

      <h2>Bigger picture</h2>
      <p>
        SensorFleet enables secure deployment of a comprehensive network of 
        honeypots and takes care of the tedious parts. Once the honeypots are 
        in place, additional controls are easy to deploy on the same Sensors as
        requirements evolve.

          Firewalls can block out malicious traffic from the outside but will
