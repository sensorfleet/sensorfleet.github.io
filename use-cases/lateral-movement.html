  <h2>Why it matters</h2>
  <p class="lead">
    Honeypots are an effective and low noise solution for detecting lateral
    movement and attackers who may have gained entry to the network.
    Currently, they are underutilized in the internal networks due to:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Largely manual processes needed to deploy and maintain the network of
      honeypots
    </li>
    <li>
      Concerns over the proper isolation of honeypots from the rest of the
      network
    </li>
    <li>
      Lack of easy results retrieval from a large network of honeypots
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    SensorFleet enables secure deployment of a comprehensive network of
    honeypots and takes care of the tedious parts. Once the honeypots are in
    place, additional controls are easy to deploy on the same Sensors as
    requirements evolve.
