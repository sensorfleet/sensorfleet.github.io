2.3.12: stable 2021-12-17

Notes on log4shell patches:
  According to Elastic's updated Security Advisory, Logstash is not affected by the newer CVE-2021-45046.
  Just to be sure, we decided to remove the potentially flawed Java class anyway. Hence, SF-2406.
  Also it is not known if Arkime (a main component of Recorder) was affected, but because it contains a vulnerable
  ElasticSearch component we're patching it anyway.
