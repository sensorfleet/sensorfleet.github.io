    Do you have visibility into the factory floor and processes while data
    networks live in a parallel universe?
  </h1>

  <p>
    Operational Technology (OT), whether factories or other infrastructure, is
    increasingly getting connected, but often lacks behind the IT networks in
    cybersecurity monitoring. Do any of the following challenges sound familiar?

      In this situation, it is beneficial to start from identifying the assets
      and connections first. While an IT-like approach, e.g. attack detection is
      useful also in the OT networks, jumping straight to the deep end can lead
      to noise and false positives.

    <h2>How SensorFleet can help</h2>
    <p>
      SensorFleet NDR solution hosts and runs a diverse set of network
      monitoring capabilities (Instruments) on a single open platform. The user
      can build visibility into their networks in a stepwise approach, e.g.:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 10px">
        Add Instruments like
        <a href="/instruments/tgmanager/">Traffic Guard</a>,
        <a href="/instruments/beacon/">Beacon</a> and
        <a href="/instruments/portdiff/">PortDiff</a> for inventorying the
        assets and connections, hardening and closing the unnecessary services
        while at it.
      </li>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 10px">
        Once the baseline has been established, use these same Instruments for
        continuous integrity monitoring.
      </li>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 10px">
        The next step could be systematic log collection with the help of
        <a href="/instruments/logforwarder/">Log Forwarder</a>, or attack
        detection with the
        <a href="/instruments/suricata/">Suricata IDS Instrument</a>.
      </li>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 10px">
        Now you have comprehensive 24/7 detection capabilities up and running.
        Maybe itâ€™s good time to add Instruments aiding in forensics, such as
        <a href="/instruments/netflow/">Netflow collector</a> and
        <a href="/instruments/recorder/">Traffic Recorder</a>? It is just few
        clicks away.
      </li>
    </ol>

  <h2>Processing the results</h2>

  <p>
    While SensorFleet provides tools for processing the alerts and built-in
    forensic Instruments, many customers opt for exporting the data into a SIEM.
    We provide interfaces for an easy SIEM integration to various platforms,
    e.g. Azure Sentinel, Elastic Stack and many more.
