        Do you have visibility into the factory floor and processes while data
        networks live in a parallel universe?
      </h1>
      <p>
        Operational Technology (OT), whether factories or other infrastructure, is
        increasingly getting connected, but often lacks behind the IT networks in
        cybersecurity monitoring. Do any of the following challenges sound familiar?

          <p>
            Lack of visibility on network assets and missing dynamic tracking of the
            new assets

          <p>
            Missing network segregation or no mechanisms to verify the segregation

      <p>
        In this situation, it is beneficial to start from identifying the assets
        and connections first. While an IT-like approach, e.g. attack detection is
        useful also in the OT networks, jumping straight to the deep end can lead
        to noise and false positives.

        <h2>How SensorFleet can help</h2>
        <p>
          SensorFleet NDR solution hosts and runs a diverse set of network
          monitoring capabilities (Instruments) on a single open platform. The user
          can build visibility into their networks in a stepwise approach, e.g.:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Add Instruments like
            <a href="/instruments/tgmanager/">Traffic Guard</a>,
            <a href="/instruments/beacon/">Beacon</a> and
            <a href="/instruments/portdiff/">PortDiff</a> for inventorying the
            assets and connections, hardening and closing the unnecessary services
            while at it.
          </li>
          <li>
            Once the baseline has been established, use these same Instruments for
            continuous integrity monitoring.
          </li>
          <li>
            The next step could be systematic log collection with the help of
            <a href="/instruments/logforwarder/">Log Forwarder</a>, or attack
            detection with the
            <a href="/instruments/suricata/">Suricata IDS Instrument</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Now you have comprehensive 24/7 detection capabilities up and running.
            Maybe it’s good time to add Instruments aiding in forensics, such as
            <a href="/instruments/netflow/">Netflow collector</a> and
            <a href="/instruments/recorder/">Traffic Recorder</a>? It is just few
            clicks away.
          </li>
        </ol>

      <h2>Processing the results</h2>
      <p>
        While SensorFleet provides tools for processing the alerts and built-in
        forensic Instruments, many customers opt for exporting the data into a SIEM.
        We provide interfaces for an easy SIEM integration to various platforms,
        e.g. Azure Sentinel, Elastic Stack and many more.
