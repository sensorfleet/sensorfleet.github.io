<h1 class="mt-5">About us</h1>
<p class="lead">
  Our team has a long experience in developing cyber security sensor technology for a national early warning
  system protecting the critical infrastructure in Finland. At the inception of SensorFleet in 2018, we set
  out to re-imagine cyber security monitoring.
</p>
<p>
<p>
  SensorFleet is an open sensor platform that can host detection-, protection- and scanning tools - that we
  call Instruments - from 3rd parties, whether commercial, open source or inhouse developed. Solution reduces
  complexity in managing cyber security capabilities and readily available deployment platform increases
  response times for emerging threats.

  Vesihiisi project develops an open and scalable platform, SensorFleet, for network
  level cyber security
  monitoring. Platform enables emergence of an open ecosystem for development and
  distribution of cyber
  security monitoring capabilities. SensorFleet prototype will be further developed to
  production level
  maturity in this project.
