  <h1 class="mt-5">Our Approach</h1>
  <p class="lead">
    Our team has long experience on developing network security sensor technology for a national Security Operations Centre protecting the critical infrastructure in Finland. At the inception of SensorFleet, we set out to re-imagine network level detection and solve the pain points we had observed over the years.
  </p>
  <p>
  The key issue we wanted to resolve was a difficulty of deploying new detection and protection tools and limited extension options for the end users. Answer to that one was simple enough: We decided to develop SensorFleet as an open sensor platform that can incorporate detection-, protection- and scanning tools (that we call instruments) from 3rd parties, whether commercial, open source or inhouse developed. There were, after all, plenty of examples on power of ecosystems enabling end users to flexibly deploy tools - or applications, plugins etc. - based on their evolving requirements. The best known being the application ecosystems that enabled smartphones to become ubiquitous devices they are today.
  </p>
  <p>
  Openness is reflected on the other fundamental design decisions of SensorFleet: We won’t appropriate your data, you will have a full visibility on sensor communication and transparency on what instruments do. More on our approach with these areas below:
  </p>
  <h4>Data</h4>
  <p>
  We won’t ask for your network data in exchange for providing the security solution for you. While aspects of data sharing, such as IoC’s, are undeniably beneficial for ecosystem at large, we believe that requirement for any sharing should be transparent, clearly defined and limited to value add services that inherently depend on sharing. Another aspect is that the unnecessary copies of the data increase exposure. Therefore our preferred approach is a large network of lightweight sensors placed into network locations where data is being produced, instead of a single large number cruncher. Rather than raking everything into a huge haystack and then looking for a needle, look for a needle from smaller bales. Just to be clear, there are legitimate reasons for collecting and storing the network data and that’s supported by SensorFleet, just not the default mode on which overall functionality of sensor network depends.
  </p>

  <h4>Sensor communication</h4>
  <p>
  Many technically oriented people are familiar with a startling feeling of observing number of connections, both inbound and outbound, that the modern applications and devices create. Since a sealed box wouldn’t be a very efficient sensor, SensorFleet will also need to communicate with outside world. What we strive for is to be clear on what each of the interfaces and connections are used for. This enables users to audit sensor and instruments based on security policies of network segments they’re protecting.

  <h4>Instruments</h4>
  <p>
  Smartphones have made it easy for us to get the tooling we need in different situations. Visit to a new city starts with installing an application for local transport, new home appliance installation comes with remote control application and so forth. SensorFleet has been designed with the same principle in mind, making it easy to add and remove instruments as the monitoring requirements evolve. Maybe, for example, your day-to-day use case involves asset tracking or threat detection with the IDS, but when a new vulnerability emerges, you’d need to run vulnerability scanning within the perimeter of network segments you operate. Having SensorFleet platform in those segments enables you to quickly run a vulnerability scanner as an instrument without extra network configuration changes or manual work for retrieving the results.

            Vesihiisi project develops an open and scalable platform, SensorFleet, for network level cyber security
            monitoring. Platform enables emergence of an open ecosystem for development and distribution of cyber
            security monitoring capabilities. SensorFleet prototype will be further developed to production level
            maturity in this project.
