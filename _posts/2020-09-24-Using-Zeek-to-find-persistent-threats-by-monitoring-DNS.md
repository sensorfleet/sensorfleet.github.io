## Introduction

Ever heard of Bro or Zeek, coolest thing(s) in network traffic analysis? Never
got around to install it? I had, many times, and never did, until now. Zeek
(formerly Bro) is a free and open-source software network analysis framework. In
this article we’re going to take a look at Zeek as an IDS engine and some
examples of what you can do with it. We are using the
[SensorFleet platform](https://sensorfleet.com/) to run
[Zeek Instrument](https://sensorfleet.com/instruments/zeek/), but you could run
Zeek on its own as well.

Many types of customizable rules are supported by Zeek, here's two:

- Scripts (using the
  [Zeek scripting engine](https://docs.zeek.org/en/current/examples/scripting/))
- Blacklists (using the
  [Zeek Intel Framework](https://docs.zeek.org/en/current/frameworks/intel.html)).

We’re going to try both of those to do something useful.

- Part 1: Deploy a script with whitelisted DHCP servers to detect rogue DHCP
  servers.
- Part 2: Add a “canary” file to an internal server to be used as a honeypot,
  and add the file hash to Zeek as a blacklist.

## Step 1: Setting up Zeek

Zeek will need a capture interface with mirrored IP traffic.

Setting that up will be heavily environment specific.

For our task, we will want the **internal** network traffic to be mirrored to
our Sensor because we want to see DHCP traffic.

Setting up a mirror interface is out of scope of this guide, but for general
guidelines:

- Have a switch capable or port mirroring
- Configure switch to mirror your internal traffic towards the sensor you’re
  running Zeek on
- Configure Zeek to listen on that mirror interface

### Generic environment

If you are installing Zeek manually, outside of SensorFleet platform, refer to
[Zeek Installation Manual](https://docs.zeek.org/en/current/install/install.html).

### SensorFleet environment

We assume a preconfigured Sensor running the SensorFleet software.

We start by looking up the correct Sensor from the
[Fleet Management](https://sensorfleet.com/solution/) UI.

You can also add Zeek to your Fleet Management if that’s only that you have and
the server can handle the load.

We’re going to use “Epycprobe”, our AMD EPYC based test Sensor.

- Click from the dropdown button and choose Add Instrument.

- Navigate Zeek Instrument from the list and click Add Intrument.

    <img src="/img/posts/zeek_1_blog/02_add_instrument_2.png" title="add instrument" width=500>

- Go to FM main UI and choose Configure from the Zeek instrument.

    <img src="/img/posts/zeek_1_blog/03_configure.png" title="configure instrument" width=500>

- We need to add a capture interface before it actually can see any traffic.
  Choose Add Interface, pick correct Sensor Bridge, choose only RX capability.

    <img src="/img/posts/zeek_1_blog/04_interface.png" title="configure interface" width=500>

- Click Create.

## Step 2: View Zeek events

Zeek is now running. We can check that by viewing the events Zeek is generating.

### Generic environment

If you’re running outside of SensorFleet platform, refer to
[Logging in Zeek Manual](https://docs.zeek.org/en/current/examples/logs/).

Zeek logs individual event types into log files by default, e.g.
_base.protocols.conn_ logs to conn.log which could be found in
/opt/zeek/logs/current/conn.log depending on the installation.

### SensorFleet environment

<img src="/img/posts/zeek_1_blog/05_view_events.png" title="View zeek events" width=500>

Zeek is quite noisy by default: an event is generated _per connection_! That is
a lot of events and a lot of useless information for many use cases. Unless
you’re going to use Zeek as a network history audit tool, you probably want to
disable a lot of the default connections. Another approach would be to generate
lots of events, and handle them in SIEM accordingly.

## Step 3: Configuring Zeek for less noise

### Generic environment

- First, locate the file init-default.zeek in your Zeek installation. In our
  case, that is located at /opt/zeek/share/zeek/base/init-default.zeek.
- Edit that file with your favorite editor and disable some modules:

  ```
  vim /opt/zeek/share/zeek/base/init-default.zeek
  ```

- If you wanted to disable all of them, you’d comment out the _@load_ lines with
  the following vim command:
  ```
  _:%s/^@load/#@load/g_
  ```
- Then save and quit using
  ```
  :wq
  ```
- Restart Zeek
  ```
  /etc/init.d/zeek restart
  ```
- Keep disabling zeek modules until you’ve reached the desired noise level in
  your event log.

### SensorFleet environment

- Navigate to Zeek Configuration menu (Zeek Instrument -> Configure -> Custom
  configuration)
- Tick off some of the noisiest base modules and hit save.

  <img src="/img/posts/zeek_1_blog/06_zeek_noise_suppress.png" title="Suppress some events from Zeek" width=500>

- Keep disabling zeek modules until you’ve reached the desired noise level in
  your event log.

- Prefer the dark, text only screen? No problem, you can use the excellent
  _fleet_ CLI tool, in our case:
  ```
  fleet config edit zeek_0@epycprobe
  ```
  For more details about the fleet CLI tool, refer to SensorFleet User Manual.

## Step 4: Add script to detect DNS anomalies

### Generic environment

- Install the dns-anomalous package using Zeek Package Manager:

  ```
  zkg install sensorfleet/anomalous-dns
  ```

- Restart Zeek instance (command may depend on installation)
  ```
  /etc/init.d/zeek restart
  ```

### SensorFleet environment

- Install IDS Rule Manager Instrument.

For managing the custom Zeek scripts, we’re using the [IDS Rule Manager
Instrument](https://sensorfleet.com/instruments/rmgr/). If you don’t have it installed yet, just add it using the UI
similarly as you added [Zeek Instrument](https://sensorfleet.com/instruments/zeek/).

- Add DNS anomaly detection script. I created a
  [single-file version](http://sensorfleet.com/misc/anomalous_dns_bundle.zeek)
  of the [anomalous-dns](https://github.com/jbaggs/anomalous-dns) Zeek package
  by github user jbaggs. I also added
  [a more aggressive whitelisting support](https://github.com/sensorfleet/anomalous-dns)
  to it. Let’s add that to our Zeek install.

- Open IDS Rule Manager Instrument UI

  <img src="/img/posts/zeek_1_blog/07_rmgr_ui.png" title="Opening IDS Rule Manager" width=500>

- Navigate to Zeek tab and click Add script

  <img src="/img/posts/zeek_1_blog/08_add_script.png" title="Add Zeek script" width=500>

- Copy the contents of the
  [anomalous-dns script](http://sensorfleet.com/misc/anomalous_dns_bundle.zeek)
  and paste it into the text field. Type some name for the script, and validate
  the syntax. Finally, click Save.

- Click Commit script changes from the IDS Rule Manager UI
  <img src="/img/posts/zeek_1_blog/09_commit.png" title="Commit script changes" width=500>

- The Zeek instance will restart with the new script shortly.

## Step 5: Configure DNS anomalies whitelist

- Navigate to Zeek events list to see if it’s producing any events. Depending on
  the network and port mirroring configuration, you might see false positives in
  the event output. For SensorFleet environment, use the UI. For generic
  environment, watch zeek’s _notice.log_.

  <img src="/img/posts/zeek_1_blog/10_events.png" title="Zeek is generating lots of notice events" width=500>

- By viewing the produced events, it seems we have some false positives. That’s
  normal, because there are e.g. some mail servers and domain handling DNS
  servers in our monitoring setup. We need to configure our whitelist.

  <img src="/img/posts/zeek_1_blog/11_noise_event.png" title="Your false positives may look like this" width=500>

- Open the script in a text editor. On SensorFleet environment, you can use the
  Rule Manager UI for editing. On Generic environment, locate anomalous-dns
  package in the Zeek installation, and open domain-whitelist.zeek in a text
  editor.
- Edit the last few lines, they look like this:

  ```
  redef domain_whitelist = /.../;
  redef local_dns_servers = set(...);
  redef totally_ignored_ips = set(...);
  ```

- Add any domains or DNS servers to appropriate whitelists. I ended up adding
  some DNS and mail servers to _totally_ignored_ips_ field to silence them, and
  a few common domains in _domain_whitelist_. There are a few syntax samples in
  the whitelist. For more details, see
  [Zeek scripting manual for set, addr and pattern](https://docs.zeek.org/en/current/examples/scripting/#data-structures).
- Save script changes and restart Zeek:
  - On SensorFleet, just re-save the script and Commit script changes.
  - On General environment, save the script and run `/etc/init.d/zeek restart`
    (depending on the platform).

## Step 6: Does it really work?

Once you have the script running, and it’s not creating too much false positives
anymore, you may want to see if it really can detect persistent DNS tunnels.
Let’s test it.

- For testing, you will need a Linux or other unix shell, or a Windows
  PowerShell capable shell in your monitored network that has the host command
  (or nslookup on windows). The host must not be whitelisted, of course.

- Command to run in unix shell: (bash-style syntax)

  ```
  for n in {1..100}; do host dnstest$n.sensorfleet.com 8.8.4.4; done
  ```

- Similar test command for Windows powershell:

  ```
  for (($n = 0); $n -lt 100; $n++) { nslookup "dnstest$i.sensorfleet.com" 8.8.4.4 }
  ```

- The test should result in an event like this:

  <img src="/img/posts/zeek_1_blog/12_test_event.png" title="Triggered test event" width=500>

  Here, the id.orig_h (or src field) is the source of our potential threat.

## Final words

You will now get a notification of anomalous DNS behaviors, such as long running
malware C&C connections over DNS. This can be fairly useful if your network is
restricted (e.g. HTTP proxy), but allows direct DNS access.

Also, some malwares might use DNS by default, even if HTTP was allowed, because
DNS might be harder to detect since they do not make direct connections to the
outside world, but instead leverage your DNS resolver.

I found out that configuring the whitelist for nearly zero false positives can
take a lot of work, though, depending on your network. That’s why I ended up
patching the [jbaggs/anomalous-dns](https://github.com/jbaggs/anomalous-dns) for
a more aggressive whitelist.

We now use the above detection method in monitoring of our own infrastructure.

Hopefully this will help someone to realize how neat things you can do just by
using open source tools such as Zeek.

It gets even easier when using commercial products to round the rough edges a
bit.

Stay tuned for the part 2 of our Zeek guide: We’re going to add a "canary" file
to an internal server to be used as a honeypot, and add the file hash to Zeek as
a blacklist.
