We recently got accepted into SynerLeap, ABB’s startup program. Mission of
SynerLeap is to foster an ecosystem for collaboration and help startups to
navigate ABB organisation.

ABB is one of the industry leaders in OT space, while OT security monitoring is
a key domain for SensorFleet. Our solution scales from specific use cases, like
asset monitoring in an OT environment, to acting as an integration platform for
a large scale NDR stack. As a software first solution, SensorFleet platform also
integrates flexibly with any equipment capable of running 3rd party
applications. These factors made it easy to find potential common interest areas
with the great team at SynerLeap.

We are eagerly looking forward to the next leaps!
