SensorFleet, the first Nordic company to offer an open, platform-based technology for Network Detection and Response (NDR) has signed a cooperation agreement with Lockheed Martin Corporation.

The agreement is for one of the indirect industrial cooperation projects related to Finland’s acquisition of F-35 fighter jets. SensorFleet, together with the consortium partners from leading cybersecurity companies and academia, joins Lockheed Martin in developing new, AI-based cyber threat detection technologies and strengthening Finland’s cyber resilience.

## About the project

The project develops new, AI-based technologies for the detection of advanced cyber threats with the goal of complementing and expanding on currently available detection capabilities.

“SensorFleet has profound experience in the area of network security and our modular, open NDR platform provides building blocks that help in closing the gap between the cutting edge research and productization.” Says Sami Petäjäsoja, CEO at SensorFleet. “We are honoured to work on a forward-looking project with Lockheed Martin Corporation and our local partners.”
