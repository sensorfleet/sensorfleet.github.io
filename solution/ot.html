<h1>OT security</h1>

<p class="lead">
  Operational Technology (OT), whether factories or other infrastructure, is
  increasingly getting connected, but often lacks behind the IT networks in
  cybersecurity monitoring. Do any of the following challenges sound familiar?
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Lack of visibility on network assets and missing dynamic tracking of the new
    assets
  </li>
  <li>
    Missing network segregation or no mechanisms to verify the segregation
  </li>
  <li>Network connectivity has evolved over time and has become unclear</li>
</ul>

<p>
  It is beneficial to start from identifying the assets and connections first.
  While an IT-like approach, e.g. attack detection, is useful also in the OT
  networks, jumping straight to the deep end can lead to noise and false
  positives
</p>


  <h3>
  SensorFleet solution enables building visibility into the OT networks in a
  stepwise approach:
  </h3>

<div class="row phasecols">
  <div class="col-md-3">
    <img
      src="../img/instruments.svg"
   />
    Deploy Instruments like
    <a href="../instruments/tgmanager/">Traffic Guard</a>,
    <a href="../instruments/beacon/">Beacon</a> and
    <a href="../instruments/portdiff/">PortDiff</a> for inventorying the assets
    and connections, hardening and closing the unnecessary services while at it.
  </div>
  <div class="col-md-3">
    <img
      src="../img/reaction-time.svg"
    />
    Once the baseline has been established, use these same Instruments for
    continuous integrity monitoring.
  </div>
  <div class="col-md-3">
     <img
      src="../img/sensor-instruments.png"
    />
    The next step could be systematic log collection with the help of
    <a href="../instruments/logforwarder/">Log Forwarder</a>, or attack detection with the
    <a href="../instruments/suricata/">Suricata IDS Instrument</a>.
  </div>
   <div class="col-md-3">
    <img
      src="../img/instrument-cart.png"
    />
    Now you have comprehensive 24/7 detection capabilities up and running. Maybe
    it's a good time to add Instruments aiding in forensics, such as
    <a href="../instruments/netflow/">Netflow collector</a> and
    <a href="../instruments/recorder/">Traffic Recorder</a>? They are just a few
    clicks away.
