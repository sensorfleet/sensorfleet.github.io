    Operational Technology (OT), whether factories or other infrastructure, is
    increasingly getting connected, but often lacks behind the IT networks in
    cybersecurity monitoring. Do any of the following challenges sound familiar?
  </p>
  <ul class="lead">
    <li>
      Lack of visibility on network assets and missing dynamic tracking of the
      new assets
    </li>
    <li>
      Missing network segregation or no mechanisms to verify the segregation
    </li>
    <li>Network connectivity has evolved over time and has become unclear</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="block">
  <h2>Build visibility into the OT networks in a stepwise approach</h2>
  <p>
    It is beneficial to start from identifying the assets and connections first.
    While an IT-like approach, e.g. attack detection, is useful also in the OT
    networks, jumping straight to the deep end can lead to noise and false
    positives

            Now you have comprehensive 24/7 detection capabilities up and
            running. Maybe it's a good time to add Instruments aiding in
            forensics, such as
            <a href="../instruments/netflow/">Netflow collector</a> and
            <a href="../instruments/recorder/">Traffic Recorder</a>? They are
