  SensorFleet NDR comes exactly in the shape and size you’ll need. What’s more,
  you can dynamically grow your capability fabric, expanding security monitoring
  into the domains like OT, or adding new capabilities for IT infrastructure
  monitoring. We have put together a few example Sensor configurations for IT
  networks.

  <h2>Integrity monitoring</h2>
  <p>
    Understanding what is in your network and pruning out the unnecessary assets
    and services will make it difficult for an attacker to gain a foothold. We
    have a set of Instruments to do just that:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href="../instruments/assetguard/">Asset Guard</a>
      learns and inventories your network assets. After the initial inventory,
      it monitors the network continuously, alerting about the new assets. Catch
      rogue assets and verify that the actual assets in network and
      documentation stay in sync.
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="../instruments/portdiff/">PortDiff</a>
      provides an automated scanning for the open services in the network.
      PortDiff makes it easy to spot misconfigured software and devices, while
      also detecting suspicious ports, such as IRC.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Integrity monitoring is best suited for server networks, data centers, DMZ
    and similar, relatively static networks. This low noise configuration
    detects the issues that are easy and quick to fix.

  <h2>Attack detection</h2>
  <!--Kommentti auki docsissa-->
  <p>
    IDS-based real-time network traffic monitoring for attacks is a tried and
    proven technology. In practice, deploying and managing multiple IDS’s for
    good coverage has been a major obstacle for adoption. SensorFleet removes
    the obstacle with a unified deployment and management platform across
    multiple networks. Drop in the Instruments for forensics, and you’ll have an
    attack detection powerhouse:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href="../instruments/suricata/">Suricata</a>
      is a widely used IDS engine with readily available rulesets. SensorFleet
      platform makes it easy to deploy and manage Suricata at scale
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="../instruments/passivedns/">PassiveDNS</a>
      will augment IDS alerts with the DNS information
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="../instruments/recorder/">Traffic Recorder</a>
      automatically generates packet captures for the alerts and comes with a
      built in analytics tool for the captures
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="block">
  <h2>Lateral movement detection</h2>
  <p>
    When an attacker gains a foothold in the network, they typically do
    reconnaissance to map the terrain with a goal to grab valuable information
    from an organization. Trap them with:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href="../instruments/cowrie/">Honeypots</a>. SensorFleet platform makes
      it easy and safe to deploy honeypots in your critical network segments
    </li>
    <li>
      <!--Miten blogeihin linkataan. Tässä vois olla linkki zeek-canary blogiin-->
      Canary files. To level up your lateral movement monitoring, augment it
      with the combination of canary files and
      <a href="../instruments/zeek/">Zeek</a>
      to detect when someone grabs them
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Lateral movement detection is a low noise configuration, typically producing
    high priority alerts. The Instruments used for detection provide not only
    the alerts, but also associated forensic data to help with the
    investigation.
