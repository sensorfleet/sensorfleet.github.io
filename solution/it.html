<h1>IT Security</h1>

<p>
  SensorFleet NDR comes exactly in the shape and size you’ll need. What’s more,
  you can dynamically grow your capability fabric, expanding security monitoring
  into the domains like OT, or adding new capabilities for IT infrastructure
  monitoring. We have put together a few example Sensor configurations for IT
  networks.
</p>

<h3>Integrity monitoring</h3>

<p>
  Understanding what is in your network and pruning out the unnecessary assets
  and services will make it difficult for an attacker to gain a foothold. We
  have a set of Instruments to do just that:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Traffic Guard learns and inventories your network assets. After the initial
    inventory, it monitors the network continuously, alerting about the new
    assets. Catch rogue assets and verify that what’s in your network
    corresponds to documentation.
  </li>
  <li>
    PortDiff provides an automated scanning for the open services in the
    network. PortDiff makes it easy to spot misconfigured software and devices,
    while also detecting suspicious ports, such as IRC.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Integrity monitoring is best suited for server networks, data centers, DMZ and
  similar, relatively static networks. This low noise configuration detects the
  issues that are easy and quick to fix.
</p>

<h3>Lateral movement detection</h3>
<p>
  When an attacker gains a foothold in the network, they typically do
  reconnaissance to map the terrain with a goal to grab valuable information
  from an organization. Trap them with:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Honeypots. SensorFleet platform makes it easy and safe to deploy honeypots
    in your critical network segments
  </li>
  <li>
    Canary files. To level up your lateral movement monitoring, augment it with
    the combination of canary files and Zeek to detect when someone grabs them
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Lateral movement detection is a low noise configuration, typically producing
  high priority alerts. The Instruments used for detection provide not only the
  alerts, but also associated forensic data to help with the investigation.
</p>

<h3>Attack detection</h3>

<!--Kommentti auki docsissa-->
<p>
  IDS-based real-time network traffic monitoring for attacks is a tried and
  proven technology. In practice, deploying and managing multiple IDS’s for good
  coverage has been a major obstacle for adoption. SensorFleet removes the
  obstacle with a unified deployment and management platform across multiple
  networks. Drop in the Instruments for forensics, and you’ll have an attack
  detection powerhouse:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Suricata is a widely used IDS engine with readily available rulesets.
    SensorFleet platform makes it easy to manage and deploy Suricata at scale
  </li>
  <li>
    PassiveDNS will augment the IDS alerts with DNS information PassiveDNS will
    augment the IDS alerts with DNS information
  </li>
  <li>
    Traffic Recorder automatically generates packet captures for the alerts and
    comes with a built in analytics tool for the captures
  </li>
</ul>

    <h3>OT security</h3>
    <p>
      Operational Technology (OT), whether factories or other infrastructure, is
      increasingly getting connected, but often lacks behind the IT networks in
      cybersecurity monitoring.

    <h3>SensorFleet for industrial equipment integration</h3>
    <p>
      Do you offer networked industrial equipment that’s shipped to remote
      corners of the world? There may be maintenance contracts that go with it,
      while the overall network is not in your control. SensorFleet platform has
      been designed to integrate into the diverse execution environments and can
      provide built-in security monitoring.
