<p class="lead">
  SensorFleet solution forms a lightweight and distributed cyber capability
  fabric. Instruments are components dedicated for specific monitoring tasks and
  are installed on a Sensor Platform. Sensor Platform will be deployed either as
  a hardware or virtual appliance. Virtual appliance or Cloud Service based
  Fleet Management controls the fleet of sensors and orchestrates Instrument
  deployments.

<h2>Instruments</h2>
<p>
  Applications dedicated for specific cyber security tasks and deployed on a
  Sensor platform.

<div id="instruments-more" class="more-hidden">
  <ul>
    <li>
      Are containerized software components for specific cyber security related
      monitoring tasks
    </li>
    <li>
      Examples of SensorFleet solution Instruments include Suricata IDS, Cowrie
      Honeypot and PassiveDNS collector
    </li>
    <li>
      Can augment alerts generated by the other Instruments. For example,
      PassiveDNS can add domain names to Suricata alerts
    </li>
    <li>
      Can be chained. For example, identities captured with Cowrie Honeypot can
      be added on Suricata watchlist
    </li>
    <li>
      Users can develop or integrate their own Instruments. Any software that
      can be deployed as a container transforms easily to Instrument
    </li>
  </ul>

<h2>Sensor</h2>
<p>
  Sensor platform is deployed as a cloud native, virtual or hardware appliance.
  Also available for integration into other products, e.g. IoT industrial
  equipment.
</p>
<a
  href="#"
  id="sensor-more-show"
  class="showhide-control"
  onclick="showHide('sensor-more'); return false;"
  >Show more....</a
>
<div id="sensor-more" class="more-hidden">
  <ul>
    <li>
      Hosts the Instruments, providing a deployment platform and containment
    </li>
    <li>Installed either as a hardware appliance or virtual appliance</li>
    <li>
      Provides the API's for custom developed Insturuments. Available for both
      users and partners
    </li>
    <li>
      Sensor - A term for an individual instance of Sensor Platform with the set
      of Instruments, running either on hardware or virtual appliance
    </li>
  </ul>

  </p>
</div>

<h2>Fleet Management</h2>
<p>
  Fleet Management controls a fleet of Sensors and provides one-click deployment
  of the Instruments.
</p>
<a
  href="#"
  id="fm-more-show"
  class="showhide-control"
  onclick="showHide('fm-more'); return false;"
  >Show more....</a

<div id="fm-more" class="more-hidden">
  <ul>
    <li>Used for deploying Instruments across the fleet of Sensors</li>
    <li>
      Provides control and policy enforcement for the data sharing and retention
    </li>
    <li>
      Collects the events and alerts produced by the fleet of Sensors and can
      export them to external analytics solutions
    </li>
    <li>
      Offers IoCs, blacklists, rule sets and other configuration options to
      Sensors conveniently from single interface
    </li>
  </ul>

<h2>Use cases</h2>

<div class="row boxes">
  <div class="col-md-3 text-center">
    <h3>OT security</h3>
    <p>
      Operational Technology (OT), whether factories or other infrastructure, is
      increasingly getting connected, but often lacks behind the IT networks in
      cybersecurity monitoring.

  <div class="col-md-3 text-center">
    <h3>IT security</h3>
    <p>
      SensorFleet NDR comes exactly in the shape and size you’ll need. What’s
      more, you can dynamically grow your capability fabric, expanding security
      monitoring into the domains like OT, or adding new capabilities for IT
      infrastructure monitoring. We have put together a few example Sensor
      configurations for IT networks.
