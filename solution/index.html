<p class="lead">
  SensorFleet solution enables lightweight and distributed cyber security
  monitoring. Instruments are components dedicated for specific monitoring tasks
  and are installed on a Sensor Platform. Sensor Platform will be deployed
  either as a hardware or virtual appliance. Virtual appliance or Cloud Sevice
  based Fleet Management controls the fleet of sensors and orchestrates
  Instrument deployments.

<h3>Instruments</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Are containerized software components for specific cyber security related
    monitoring tasks
  </li>
  <li>
    Examples of SensorFleet solution Instruments include Suricata IDS, Cowrie
    Honeypot and PassiveDNS collector
  </li>
  <li>
    Can augment alerts generated by the other Instruments. For example,
    PassiveDNS can add domain names to Suricata alerts
  </li>
  <li>
    Can be chained. For example, identities captured with Cowrie Honeypot can be
    added on Suricata watchlist
  </li>
  <li>
    Users can develop or integrate their own Instruments. Any software that can
    be deployed as a container transforms easily to Instrument
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Sensor platform</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Hosts the Instruments, providing a deployment platform and containment
  </li>
  <li>Installed either as a hardware appliance or virtual appliance</li>
  <li>
    Provides the API's for custom developed Insturuments. Available for both
    users and partners
  </li>
  <li>
    Sensor - A term for an individual instance of Sensor Platform with the set
    of Instruments, running either on hardware or virtual appliance
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Fleet Management</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Used for deploying Instruments across the fleet of Sensors</li>
  <li>
    Provides control and policy enforcement for the data sharing and retention
  </li>
  <li>
    Collects the events and alerts produced by the fleet of Sensors and can
    export them to external analytics solutions
  </li>
  <li>
    Offers IoC, blacklist, ruleset and other configuration options of Sensors
    conveniently from single interface
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Why SensorFleet</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    SensorFleet solution enables you to deploy multiple cyber security
    capabilities as Instruments on unified platform, reducing complexity and
    fragmentation of security tools palette
  </li>

  <li>
    Open ecosystem reduces vendor lock and improves capability to react to
    emerging threats. Instruments developed by 3rd parties, whether commercial,
    inhouse or open souce, can be integrated
  </li>

  <li>
    Monitoring of diverse networks on a single platform, whether IT, operational
    networks or cloud services, simplifies security operations and help in
    tracking threats across organization
  </li>

  <li>
    Distributed monitoring is resilient and safeguards the forensic capability.
    Each Sensor is capable of operating in isolation from the rest of Sensor
    network and maintains it's own copy of collected alert- and forensic data
  </li>
</ul>
