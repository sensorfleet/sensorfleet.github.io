<p class="lead">
  SensorFleet solution forms a lightweight and distributed cyber capability
  fabric. Instruments are components dedicated for specific monitoring tasks and
  are installed on a Sensor Platform. Sensor Platform will be deployed either as
  a hardware or virtual appliance. Virtual appliance or Cloud Service based
  Fleet Management controls the fleet of sensors and orchestrates Instrument
  deployments.

<h2>Instruments</h2>
<p>
  Applications dedicated for specific cyber security tasks and deployed on a
  Sensor platform.

<div id="instruments-more" class="more-hidden">
  <ul>
    <li>
      Instrumens are containerized software components for specific cyber
      security related monitoring tasks
    </li>
    <li>
      Can augment alerts generated by the other Instruments. For example,
      PassiveDNS can add domain names to Suricata alerts
    </li>
    <li>
      Can be chained. For example, identities captured with Cowrie Honeypot can
      be added on Suricata watchlist
    </li>
    <li>
      Users can develop or integrate their own Instruments. Any software that
      can be deployed as a container transforms easily to Instrument
    </li>
  </ul>

<h2>Sensor</h2>
<p>
  Sensor platform is deployed as a cloud native, virtual or hardware appliance.
  Also available for integration into other products, e.g. IoT industrial
  equipment.
</p>
<a
  href="#"
  id="sensor-more-show"
  class="showhide-control"
  onclick="showHide('sensor-more'); return false;"
  >Show more....</a
>
<div id="sensor-more" class="more-hidden">
  <ul>
    <li>
      Sensor hosts the Instruments, providing a deployment platform and
      containment
    </li>
    <li>
      Provides the API's for custom developed Insturuments. Available for both
      users and partners
    </li>
    <li>
      Use cases provide a few examples of what we can deliver pre-configured
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    <a
      href="#"
      id="sensor-more-hide"

<h2>Fleet Management</h2>
<p>
  Fleet Management controls a fleet of Sensors and provides one-click deployment
  of the Instruments.
</p>
<a
  href="#"
  id="fm-more-show"
  class="showhide-control"
  onclick="showHide('fm-more'); return false;"
  >Show more....</a
>
<div id="fm-more" class="more-hidden">
  <ul>
    <li>
      Fleet Management is used for deploying Instruments across the fleet of
      Sensors
    </li>
    <li>
      Provides control and policy enforcement for the data sharing and retention
    </li>
    <li>
      Collects the events and alerts produced by the fleet of Sensors and
      exports them to SIEM or other analytics solutions
    </li>
    <li>
      Offers IoCs, blacklists, rule sets and other configuration options to
      Sensors conveniently from single interface
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    <a
      href="#"
      id="fm-more-hide"

    <h3>OT security</h3>
    <p>
      Operational Technology (OT), whether factories or other infrastructure, is
      increasingly getting connected but often lacks behind the IT networks in
      cybersecurity monitoring.

    <h3>IT security</h3>
    <p>
      SensorFleet NDR comes in the shape and size you’ll need. You can
      dynamically grow your capability fabric and add Instruments as the
      requirements evolve. We have put together a few example Sensor
      configurations for IT networks.
