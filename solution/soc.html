  Are you looking for solutions to expand your toolbox for providing SOC
  services for your customers? The following considerations may sound familiar:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    How well does the new tool integrate with our service production back-end
  </li>
  <li>
    A jungle of licensing options makes it difficult to price the service in
    competitive market
  </li>
  <li>
    One size fits none - making it hard to balance the tools portfolio for
    varying customer requirements
  </li>
</ul>
