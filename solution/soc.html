    Are you looking for solutions to expand your toolbox for providing SOC
    services for your customers? The following considerations may sound
    familiar:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      How well does the new tool integrate with our service production back-end
    </li>
    <li>
      A jungle of licensing options makes it difficult to price the service in
      competitive market
    </li>
    <li>
      One size fits none - making it hard to balance the tools portfolio for
      varying customer requirements
    </li>
  </ul>
