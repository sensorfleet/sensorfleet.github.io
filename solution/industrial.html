<h1>SensorFleet for industrial equipment integration</h1>

<!--Kommentti auki docsissa-->
<p>
  Do you offer networked industrial equipment that’s shipped to remote corners
  of the world? There may be maintenance contracts that go with it, while the
  overall network is not in your control. SensorFleet platform has been designed
  to integrate into the diverse execution environments and can provide built-in
  security monitoring:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Resident, modular platform supports long lifecycle of the industrial
    equipment
  </li>
  <li>
    Opens up opportunities to provide security monitoring as a value added
    service
  </li>
  <li>
    Should one equipment come under cyber attack, provides fast reaction
    capability to protect the rest of the install base
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Cyber security threat landscape evolves fast, while the industrial equipment
  can remain in production for decades. With the SensorFleet unique Instrument
  approach, cyber security capabilities are dynamically kept up to date without
  service interruptions.

      SensorFleet NDR comes exactly in the shape and size you’ll need. What’s
      more, you can dynamically grow your capability fabric, expanding security
      monitoring into the domains like OT, or adding new capabilities for IT
      infrastructure monitoring. We have put together a few example Sensor
      configurations for IT networks.
