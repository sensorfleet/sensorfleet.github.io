    Do you offer networked industrial equipment that’s shipped to remote corners
    of the world? There may be maintenance contracts that go with it, while the
    overall network is not in your control. SensorFleet platform has been designed
    to integrate into the diverse execution environments and can provide built-in
    security monitoring:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Resident, modular platform supports long lifecycle of the industrial
      equipment
    </li>
    <li>
      Opens up opportunities to provide security monitoring as a value added
      service
    </li>
    <li>
      Should one equipment come under cyber attack, provides fast reaction
      capability to protect the rest of the install base
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Cyber security threat landscape evolves fast, while the industrial equipment
    can remain in operation for decades. With the SensorFleet unique Instrument
    approach, cyber security capabilities are dynamically kept up to date without
    service interruptions.
