description: Log Forwarder is an instrument that integrates
  logstash open source log/event pipeline engine into the SensorFleet platform.
  You can use it to forward log and event data from an external source
  or SensorFleet event pipeline into an external destination.
  You can also use standard logstash functions to mutate data and
  receive/transmit in many different formats and protocols.

  Unlike the Event Exporter Instrument, Log Forwarder
  can also PUSH events to external systems, unlike the PULL model
  only supported by Event Exporter.
