<p>
  Netflow is used to create NetFlow information from listened network traffic.
  For introduction to NetFlow, see
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetFlow">Wikipedia</a>.
</p>
<p>
  The Instrument will listen captured traffic on mirror-bridge interface and
  store information about observed traffic flows (as identified by source and
  destination IP addresses and protocol -specific ports) in NetFlow records.
  These NetFlow records can then be downloaded from the Instrument using the
  provided HTTP API. The Instrument also provides UI which can be used to view
  stored NetFlow records.
</p>
<p>
  NetFlow records are stored in NetFlow format version 9 and they are stored in
  time-based fashion with new NetFlow file created every 5 minutes.
</p>
<h2 id="api">API</h2>
<p>The HTTP API provides endpoints for getting:</p>
<ul>
  <li>List of all NetFlow files available</li>
  <li>A NetFlow file with a specified name</li>
  <li>A “next” NetFlow file (in time -based series) from given one</li>
</ul>
