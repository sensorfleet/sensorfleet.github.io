<p>
  Netflow can be used to collect NetFlow information from network traffic. For
  introduction to NetFlow, see
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetFlow">Wikipedia</a>.
</p>
<p>
  The Instrument will listen traffic on mirror-bridge interface and store the
  traffic flows (as identified by source and destination IP addresses and
  protocol -specific ports) in NetFlow records. These NetFlow records can then
  be downloaded from the Instrument using the provided HTTP API.
</p>
<p>
  NetFlow records are stored in NetFlow format version 9 and they are stored in
  time-based fashion with new NetFlow file created every 5 minutes.
</p>
<h2 id="api">API</h2>
<p>The HTTP API provides endpoints for getting:</p>
<ul>
  <li>List of all NetFlow files available</li>
  <li>A NetFlow file with a specified name</li>
  <li>A “next” NetFlow file (in time -based series) from given one</li>
</ul>
