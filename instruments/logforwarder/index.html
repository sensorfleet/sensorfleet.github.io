<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>
  Log Forwarder Instrument integrates
  <a href="https://www.elastic.co/logstash">Logstash</a> open source log/event
  pipeline engine into the SensorFleet platform. You can use it to forward log
  and event data from an external source or SensorFleet event pipeline into an
  external destination. You can also use standard Logstash functions to mutate
  data and receive/transmit in many formats and protocols.
</p>
<h2 id="use-cases">Use cases</h2>
<p>
  Log Forwarder is a multipurpose log and event forwarding tool. Here are some
  useful examples.
</p>
<h3 id="log-collection-and-export-to-external-system">
  Log Collection and export to external system
</h3>
<p>
  You can make Log Forwarder act e.g. as a syslog target on the edge, collect
  log data on your network devices, store them locally in case of connectivity
  issues and forward them reliably into an external log destination such as
  Azure Sentinel, ElasticSearch, another syslog or another Logstash.
</p>
<h3 id="event-export-from-sensorfleet-to-external-system">
  Event Export from SensorFleet to external system
</h3>
<p>
  You can use Log Forwarder to get SensorFleet events and forward them to
  external systems, such as ElasticSearch, Azure Sentinel or another Logstash
  using the HTTP output.
</p>
<p>
  This works by using the Event Subscription feature built into the Log
  Forwarder. You can use custom event search terms to get only wanted events and
  push them into the Logstash HTTP input module for forwarding.
