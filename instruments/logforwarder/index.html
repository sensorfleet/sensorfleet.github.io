title: Log Forwarder Instrument
description: Log Forwarder is an instrument that integrates logstash open source log/event pipeline engine into the SensorFleet platform. You can use it to forward log and event data from an external source or SensorFleet event pipeline into an external destination. You can also use standard logstash functions to mutate data and receive/transmit in many different formats and protocols.
Unlike the Event Exporter Instrument, Log Forwarder can also PUSH events to external systems, unlike the PULL model only supported by Event Exporter.

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>
  Log Forwarder is an instrument that integrates
  <a href="https://www.elastic.co/logstash">Logstash</a> open source<br />
  log/event pipeline engine into the SensorFleet platform.<br />
  You can use it to forward log and event data from an external source or
  SensorFleet event pipeline into an external destination. You can also use
  standard Logstash functions to mutate data and receive/transmit in many
  different formats and protocols.
</p>
<p>
  Unlike the Event Exporter Instrument, Log Forwarder can also PUSH events to
  external systems.
</p>
<h2 id="use-cases">Use cases</h2>
<p>
  Log Forwarder is a multipurpose log and event forwarding tool. Here are some
  useful examples.
</p>
<h3 id="log-collection-and-export-to-external-system">
  Log Collection and export to external system
</h3>
<p>
  You can make Log Forwarder act e.g.Â as a syslog target on the edge, collect
  log data on your network devices, store them locally in case of connectivity
  issues and forward them reliably into an external log destination such as
  Azure Sentinel, ElasticSearch, another syslog or another Logstash.
</p>
<h3 id="event-export-from-sensorfleet-to-external-system">
  Event Export from SensorFleet to external system
</h3>
<p>
  You can use Log Forwarder to get SensorFleet events and forward them to
  external systems, such as ElasticSearch, Azure Sentinel or another Logstash
  using the Lumberjack output.
</p>
<p>
  This works by using the Event Subscription feature built into the Log
  Forwarder. You can use custom event search terms to get only wanted events and
  push them into the Logstash HTTP input module for forwarding.
