  <a href="https://zeek.org/">Zeek</a> (formerly Bro) is an open source network
  security monitoring tool. Zeek has been integrated as a SensorFleet instrument
  and is capable of stateful inspection of network traffic on a wide variety of
  protocols. Zeek is configured with Zeek scripting language and utilizes the
  <a href="https://sensorfleet.com/instruments/rmgr/"
    >IDS Rule Manager Instrument</a
  >
  for scripts and blacklists.
</p>
<p>
  When compared to the similar, but different,
  <a href="https://sensorfleet.com/instruments/suricata/"
    >Suricata IDS Instrument</a
  >, the main difference is that Zeek supports a more complex scripting
  language. For example, packet analyzer can perform complex database lookups
  and complex conditional logic. Suricata is meant for analyzing higher amount
  of traffic but not as deep level as Zeek.
</p>
<p>Two types of customizable rules are supported by the Zeek Instrument:</p>
<ol type="1">
  <li>
    <p>
      Zeek Scripts. For details, see
      <a href="https://docs.zeek.org/en/current/examples/scripting/index.html"
        >Zeek Scripting</a
      >. Scripts can be configured by
      <a href="https://sensorfleet.com/instruments/rmgr/"
        >IDS Rule Manager Instrument</a
      >.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Blacklists which utilize
      <a href="https://docs.zeek.org/en/current/frameworks/intel.html"
        >Zeek Intel Framework</a
      >. Blacklists can be configured by
      <a href="https://sensorfleet.com/instruments/rmgr/"
        >IDS Rule Manager Instrument</a
      >.

<h2 id="loadable-module-and-log-suppression">
  Loadable module and log suppression
</h2>
<p>
  Zeek Instrument integrates functionality to selectively load modules and
  suppress log output. For example, you can load the base/protocols/dns module
  for other purposes but suppress all of it’s log output.
