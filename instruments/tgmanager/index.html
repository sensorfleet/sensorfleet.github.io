  Traffic Guard Manager gathers the identities reported by TrafficGuard Probe
  and creates events based on identity changes.
</p>
<p>
  With TrafficGuard Manager UI it’s easy to view assets currently active on
  monitored network and get events on new assets.

<p>
  TrafficGuard Probe Instrument is set to monitor a protected network which has
  stable set of assets deployed. TrafficGuard Manager will gather all
  information detected by the Probe Instrument.
</p>
<p>
  First TrafficGuard Manager collects information on assets currently running on
  the network. These assets can be marked as known and then it’s easy to
  discover if new assets appear on the monitored network. This allows to quickly
  react to rogue devices appearing on the protected network due to
  misconfiguration or malicious activity.
