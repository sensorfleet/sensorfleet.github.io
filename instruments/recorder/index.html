<!-- File is generated automatically, do not edit directly. -->

<p>
  Provides packet recording capability to SensorFleet Sensor. Recording can be
  triggered by Suricata IDS Alerts or be continuous (full packet capture). When
  in trigger-based mode, Traffic Recorder will only record traffic related to
  the triggering event.
</p>
<p>
  Recorder delays traffic to the temporary in-memory buffer in trigger mode.
  This allows investigating matching traffic related to triggering event before
  the event was even generated.
</p>
<p>
  Recorder internally uses a modified
  <a href="https://molo.ch/">Moloch</a> capture engine. Moloch UI is also
  provided to the user. It can be used for forensics purposes, internal
  debugging and testing.
</p>
<h3 id="pcap-export-api">PCAP export API</h3>
<p>
  Provided standard Moloch UI can be directly used to download PCAPs, but an
  alternative method is also provided for automation purposes. Instrument UI has
  a custom HTTP download endpoint. The API will output PCAP files containing
  traffic matching the search criteria.

  Example use case: Traffic Recorder in trigger mode with Suricata IDS
</h2>
<p>
  A typical use case is to combine Recorder with Suricata IDS: only relevant
  traffic is recorded requiring much less system resources. Suricata IDS
  analyzes live traffic and produces alert events for traffic that matches the
  rule set.
</p>
<p>
  Recorder receives the alert, creates a filtering rule internally and records
  matching IP traffic. Since Recorder has a delay buffer internally, no matching
  traffic is lost due to the delay from receiving Suricata alerts. Recorder can
  also be configured to continuous recoding mode (full packet capture) which
  requires much more system resources.
