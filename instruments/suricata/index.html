  <a href="https://suricata-ids.org/">Suricata Intrusion Detection System</a> is
  a network threat detection engine. The integration to SensorFleet solution
  allows easily deployable and manageable intrusion detection.
</p>
<p>
  Suricata IDS has been tightly integrated into SensorFleet solution. Instrument
  provides an easy way for system administrators to deploy Suricata IDS
  instances in the network. Rule lists can be managed using either Rule Manager
  Instrument or Rule Importer Instrument without resorting into a command line
  interface, which is the usual approach for plain Suricata installations.
