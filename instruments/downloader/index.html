<p>
  Helper Instrument providing other Instruments the ability to download
  resources outside the Sensor.
</p>
<p>
  Some Instruments do not require active network connection for their operation,
  but can use outside resources for configuration. Downloader can fetch those
  resources for Instrument and enables separating it from the network.
</p>
<p>
  Downloader Instrument fetches the resources from network and places them where
  the requesting Instrument can then read them. Downloader checks configured
  resources periodically and fetches them only if the content has been changed.
