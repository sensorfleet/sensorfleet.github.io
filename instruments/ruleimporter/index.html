<p>
  Tool for importing, generating and deploying Suricata rules from packaged rule
  sets and blacklisted addresses.
</p>
<p>
  Pre-created rules can be obtained from rule packages such as
  <a href="https://rules.emergingthreats.net/">Emerging Threats</a>. Blacklist
  rule generation supports IP addresses and DNS names with optional comment
  listed in semicolon-separated CSV file.
</p>
<p>
  These files are configured for download using Fleet Management, and Rule
  Importer does the rest. It keeps track of Suricata instruments and delivers
  rules to them when downloaded files are changed.
</p>
<p>
  Suricata group ID (gid) is added or changed from rules so Rule Importer won’t
  conflict with other rule sources such as Rule Manager Instrument.
