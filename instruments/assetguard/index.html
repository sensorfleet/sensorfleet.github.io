<p>
  Asset Guard provides visibility to the network assets by monitoring network
  traffic and gathering identities from it. It provides tools for detecting and
  naming new assets in the specified networks, sending alerts for suspicious
  assets and exporting all network assets with various observations collected
  from them.

  Asset Guard consists from two main components: Manager and Probe. Probes
  listen to the mirrored network traffic and reports its findings to the
  Manager. It wonâ€™t send anything making it ideal for the OT networks as well.
  Monitoring multiple networks and physical locations is easy just by deploying
  multiple probes. Manager then collects the results to the central location and
  allows reviewing new assets, naming them and for example examining their MAC
  and IP addresses, manufacturers and traffic amounts.
