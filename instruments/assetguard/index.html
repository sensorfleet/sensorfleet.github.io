<p>
  Asset Guard provides network asset visibility by monitoring network traffic
  and extracting identities from it. It offers various tools for detecting and
  identifying new assets within specified networks, issuing alerts for
  suspicious assets, and exporting comprehensive information collected from the
  assets.

<p>
  Asset Guard comprises two main components: Manager and Probe. Probes listen to
  mirrored network traffic and report their findings to the Manager. They
  operate in a non-intrusive manner, making them suitable for OT networks as
  well. Multiple probes can be deployed to monitor multiple networks and
  physical locations. The Manager collects the results in a central location,
  allowing users to review new assets, assign names to them, and examine their
  MAC and IP addresses, manufacturers, and traffic usage.
