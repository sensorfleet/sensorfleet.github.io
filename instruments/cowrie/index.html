  Cowrie Instrument integrates
  <a href="https://www.cowrie.org">Cowrie honeypot</a> into SensorFleet
  platform. Cowrie honeypot is a medium interaction SSH/Telnet honeypot which
  logs shell interaction and brute force login attempts from attacker.
</p>
<p>
  The Instrument will send events for user interaction with the honeypot. This
  allows to easily integrate honeypot activity into same security monitoring
  with other Instruments running on SensorFleet platform. Running honeypot
  within SensorFleet Instrument adds a layer of protection as the honeypot
  process is running inside isolated container.
</p>
<p>
  This Instrument needs active network access to run the honeypot, the network
  access can be either dedicated physical interface or network access provided
  by internal bridge interface.
</p>
<h2 id="api">API</h2>
<p>
  HTTP API provides endpoint for downloading files downloaded/uploaded into the
  honeypot by attacker.
