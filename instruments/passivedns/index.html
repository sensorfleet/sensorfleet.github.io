  PassiveDNS uses DNS events from suricata to store the DNS information. The
  database of collected address and name mappings is then used to augment name
  resolution information to Suricata IDS Instrument alerts. Whenever Suricata
  alert is received, PassiveDNS will submit another event containing names, if
  found, to IP addresses in Suricata alerts. This event might give forensic
  information about the names an address has been associated with.

  PassiveDNS also provides simple HTTP API which allows users to query the
  database that has been collected. The API provides methods for

<p>
  Following sequence shows the operation of PassiveDNS with Suricata. Whenever
  DNS response is seen, Suricata will send DNS event to internal message bus.
  This Event is received by PassiveDNS, which stores the DNS records to its
  database. Later, if Suricata alert is triggered, Suricata will create and
  alert. PassiveDNS will receive this alert and queries database of stored DNS
  records and then creates an augmentation Event containing this information.
